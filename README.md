Sign_Language_Recognition_Group12

ABSTRACT

This paper focuses on a review of the literature on hand gesture techniques and introduces their merits and limitations under different circumstances. The theories of hand segmentation and the hand detection system, which employ the Haar cascade classifier, may be used to construct hand gesture recognition using Python and OpenCV. The use of hand gestures as a natural interface motivates research in gesture taxonomies, representations, and recognition algorithms, as well as software platforms and frameworks, all of which are briefly covered in this paper. We represent a comprehensive review of vision based sign recognition algorithms published in the previous 16 years, emphasising the importance of taking these things into consideration in addition to the algorithm's recognition accuracy when predicting its successful in real world applications. 

INTRODUCTION

The increased public acceptance and funding for international projects emphasises the necessity of sign language. The desire for a computer-based solution is significant in these age of technology for the deaf people. However, re- searchers have been attacking the problem for quite sometimes now and the results are showing some promises. Although interesting technologies become available for voice recognition, but there is currently no commercial solution for sign recognition on the market. The goal is to make computers to understand human language and develop a user-friendly human computer interface (HCI). Some steps toward this goal include teaching a computer to recognise speech, facial emotions, and human gestures. Gestures are the nonverbally exchanged information. Gesture recognition is an aspect of human-computer interaction that demonstrates an academic treatise and is a vital to popularising the notion of a human-to-human connection, open dialogue, that must imply the correlation between the user and the machine.
